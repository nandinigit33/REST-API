# REST-API

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints for creating web services. RESTful web services allow systems to access and manipulate web resources through a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Unlike SOAP, which exposes its own set of operations, RESTful web services rely on simple HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
